## Music playback

- completely rewritten playback code
- easier to maintain and to add features (like syncplay, lyric support, gappless playback and more)
- media session support
- less transcoding/remuxing (better codec detection)
- will also come to video playback in the next big release
- better remote control

## Screensaver

- improved design
- added music playback
- in-app version (enabled by default)
- now works in video player! (note: not when using experimental "libvlc" implementation)

## Search

The search screen was partially rewritten to improve the performance. It will now cancel any pending search requests while typing and use
a different method for getting the results. With these changes a search on large servers will be noticably faster and no flickering occurs
anymore.
